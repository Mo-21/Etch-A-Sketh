# Etch-A-Sketh
A drawing board project built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# How it Works
The etch-a-sketch is implemented using a simple JavaScript program. When the "Press me" button is pressed, the user has to give the number of divs (squares) to be generated, it is recommended not to give less than 100. The program then creates a canvas element and binds event listeners to the mouse. When the user moves the mouse, the program fills the square on the canvas with red.
